## üìù Lab Task Overview

### Lab 5a ‚Äì Relational Database Design & Implementation

1. **Database Design**

   - Designed an **Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)** and a **UML Class Diagram** for the **ADS Dental Surgery System**.
   - Both diagrams are available as `.jpg` images and in the editable `.mdj` StarUML project file.

2. **Database Implementation**

   - Developed SQL Server script to:
     - Create normalized relational tables with primary/foreign key constraints.
     - Define appropriate data types, constraints, and relationships.
     - Populate tables with sample data for testing and demonstration.
   - Script file: `myADSDentalSurgeryDBScript.sql`

3. **Query Execution**
   - Implemented and tested key queries per lab requirements:
     - Display all dentists ordered by last name.
     - Show all appointments for a given dentist by `dentist_Id`.
     - Show all appointments scheduled at a specific surgery location.
     - Show all appointments booked for a given patient on a specific date.
   - Query results are saved as screenshots in the project folder.
